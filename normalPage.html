          LeBron James has stirred up a lot of speculation recently about his future with the Cleveland Cavaliers through his actions on social media.
          <br><br>
          Cryptic tweets and Instagram posts began surfacing after the four-time MVP visited former teammate Dwyane Wade in Miami around the all-star break. 
          <br><br>
          One Twitter user also helped stoke fans' concern by recently discovering that LeBron does not follow his team on Twitter and Instagram. 
          <br><br>
          It appears that particular fan may have a bit too much time on his hands, but it's important to point out that it's impossible to know when James unfollowed the team or if he ever followed them to begin with. 
          <br><br>
          That will likely be of little consolation for Cleveland fans hoping to keep the all-star as the team pursues its first championship title. 
          <br><br>
          James responded on the court with a huge game Monday night. He scored 33 points and recorded his 41st triple-double as the Cavs clinched their second straight Central Division title with a 124-91 victory over the Denver Nuggets. 
          <br><br>
          He refused to comment on the matter in a post-game interview. 
          <br><br>
